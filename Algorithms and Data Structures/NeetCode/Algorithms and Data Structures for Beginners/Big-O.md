# Big-{something} notations

There are three main notations to describe time complexity: Big-O ("Big-Oh"), Big-Ω ("Big-Omega"), and Big-ϴ ("Big-Theta"). 

- Big-O notation provides an upper-bound on the number of operations performed,
- Big-Ω provides a lower-bound, and Big-ϴ provides both an upper-bound and a lower-bound. In other words, 
- Big-ϴ implies both Big-O and Big-Ω.

For our purposes, we will only consider Big-O notation because, in general, we only care about upper-bounds on our algorithms.

* "Constant Time" = O(1)
* "Logarithmic Time" = "Scales/Increases Logarithmically" = O(log n)
* "Polynomial Time" = "Scales/Increases Polynomially" = O(nk) (for any constant k)
* "Exponential Time" = "Scales/Increases Exponentially" = O(kⁿ) (for any constant k)
* "Factorial Time" = O(n!)
